## How to Use (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Run the Script

```bash
python wigle_vault.py
```

### Step 2: Get Your Token When Prompted

The script will ask you to:
1. Visit https://wigle.net/account
2. Click **"Show my token"**
3. Copy the **"Encoded for use"** value
4. Paste it into the command prompt

### Step 3: Done!

All your CSVs download to the `vault` folder.

**üí° Download Interrupted or Failed?**
Just run the script again! It automatically skips files that already exist. Only missing files get downloaded.

**Works for:**
- Network timeouts
- Power loss
- Accidentally closing the window
- Large files that timed out

No wasted bandwidth. No duplicate downloads.

---

**Advanced:** You can also provide the token as an argument:
```bash
python wigle_vault.py YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

---

## What You Need

- Python 3.6 or newer
- `requests` library (install: `pip install requests`)

---

## What It Does

- Downloads every CSV file you ever uploaded to WiGLE
- Handles files of ANY size (even 100+ MB cross-country logs)
- Skips files that already exist (fully resumable)
- Shows progress as it downloads
- Works on Windows, Mac, Linux
- Streaming downloads for memory efficiency

## Common Questions

**Is this safe?**
Yes - uses official WiGLE API, read-only access, open source code.

**Can anyone intercept my data?**
NO! Direct HTTPS connection to WiGLE servers. Your data goes straight from WiGLE to your computer - nobody in between.

**Can I stop and resume?**
YES! Just run it again. It will skip every file that already downloaded and only grab what's missing. Works even if:
- Your internet cuts out
- A large file times out
- You accidentally close the window
- Your computer restarts

**How long does it take?**
Depends on file sizes. Small files = 1-2 seconds. Massive 100+ MB logs might take a few minutes each. 100 uploads usually takes 5-10 minutes total.

**Keep token secret?**
YES! Don't share it, don't commit it to git.

---

## Problems?

**401 Error** - Wrong token. Copy "Encoded for use" (not plain token).

**Network Error** - Check internet connection, try again later.
