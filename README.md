## Common Questions

Yes - uses official WiGLE API, read-only access, open source code.

**Can anyone intercept my data?**
NO! Direct HTTPS connection to WiGLE servers. Your data goes straight from WiGLE to your computer - nobody in between.

**Can I stop and resume?**
Yes - automatically skips files that already exist.

**How long does it take?**
~1-2 seconds per file. 100 uploads = ~5 minutes.

**Keep token secret?**
YES! Don't share it, don't commit it to git.

## Problems?

**401 Error** - Wrong token. Copy "Encoded for use" (not plain token).

**Network Error** - Check internet connection, try again later.
